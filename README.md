# chatgpt-python-cli
Simple chat gpt cli allowing users to communicate directly in terminal via python with CHAT GPT API, 
can take 'code' output and create files for them.

Each time the gpt response contains code (denoted by triple backtick) the code simply finds all the code snippets
using regex and offers the user to output them to a file.
